I agree           Information on Degree Program              Program profile                    Agricultural biosciences offer solutions to major societal challenges. They can make significant contributions to securing food supplies, preserving natural resources, and mitigating the effects of climate change. The M.Sc. Agricultural Biosciences is shaped by the vision of the TUM School of Life Sciences offering a basic, mechanistic understanding of biological processes underlying agricultural crop and livestock production combined with expertise in handling data rich challenges and quantitative data analysis. In contrast to other Master’s programs that have a specialized view on basic research and distinguish between plant and animal science, we at TUM believe that a generic approach is more timely as many biological mechanisms are shared between plants and animals. A strong focus on molecular as well as computational methods reflects the TUM strategy to value innovation as the basis for knowledge. The M.Sc. Agricultural Biosciences deals with different organisms, namely plants, animals and microbes. The program takes advantage of the synergistic effects created by integrated studies on plant and animal species teaching generic as well as specific biological concepts, methods and tools. It reflects the high level of innovation in agricultural biosciences and prepares graduates for a multi-path career allowing for flexibility and migration in the job market. As a graduate in Agricultural Biosciences, you will have a profound knowledge of molecular, biochemical and physiological processes contributing to agricultural production. You are able to optimize processes leading to genetic improvement of crops and livestock. Through knowledge on the genotype-phenotype relationship, you can optimize production environments. Graduates learn how to integrate heterogeneous data from different disciplines, handle large experimental data sets and become proficient in predictive analytics. You can assess molecular and computational methods with respect to their impact and trade-offs in practice and can communicate their relevance for agricultural production in a livable environment. For a comprehensive description of the program, please refer to the degree program documentation: Degree program documentation for the Master’s program in Agricultural Biosciences (PDF)           Which further expertise and skills will I acquire?       As a graduate, you will... have a profound understanding of the scientific basis of biological processes relevant for agricultural production. be able to perform research in the field of Agricultural Biosciences and can link your knowledge and results to other disciplines. be aware of societal challenges and demands in the context of Agricultural Biosciences and possess the social skills to communicate across disciplines and cultures. have developed your self-competencies for navigating in a changing environment and managing complex projects.           Which professional opportunities can I take up with this qualification?       Upon graduating, you can find employment in the national or international job market, for example at universities, research institutes, in the public sector or in biotech, breeding and life science companies. Career opportunities also open up in the field of international organizations such as the CGIAR centers, FAO and World Health Organization (WHO). Furthermore, more and more young scientists with expertise in agricultural biosciences are finding employment in smaller companies and startups in areas such as biotechnology and machine learning providing technologies or service to the agricultural sector. Graduates with combined expertise in molecular biology and quantitative and computational methods are highly sought after in the job market, as the number of graduates does not meet the demand of qualified personnel. It is expected that the demand will increase as molecular methods and machine learning will fundamentally change the agricultural sector and increase the demand for research and development.             Program structure                   During the first and second semester five compulsory modules - Physiology, Plant and Animal Cell Biology, Immunology: Crop and Livestock Health and Disease, Genetics and Genomics as well as Statistical Computing and Data Analysis - have to be completed. After passing these core courses, students possess solid knowledge in basic biological concepts relevant for agricultural production. Elective modules are very important in the study program. You can choose from a list of different lab courses that cover either molecular or computational techniques. In addition, the program offers research tool modules that allow for independent study and enable students to perform research in the field of Agricultural Biosciences. By opening a mobility window in the third semester students are encouraged to gain international study experience through exchange programs such as Erasmus+ or TUMexchange. If approved by the Examination Board you can take up a research internship outside TUM, e.g. with a qualified industry partner or an external research organization. The fourth semester is devoted to preparing the Master's thesis that concludes the study program.

The sustainable production of high-quality food must be harmonized with economic interests and questions of food security for a growing world population. In this context, society has the growing expectation to appropriately consider all of the sustainability pillars, which is reflected in public discussions, for example on the decline in biodiversity. New technologies provide important momentum for technological progress and catalysts for overcoming the challenges, but these are often viewed critically by society, such as seen in recent discussions on genetic engineering. In addition, the agricultural sector is increasingly operating in international structures. This applies both at the level of markets (international interdependencies in the private sector) and at the level of politics (e.g. through a common agricultural policy). Finally, all this is happening against the backdrop of a changing climate, which further exacerbates the scarcity of natural resources and makes sustainable production more necessary than ever. These are all reasons for the emergence of conflicting goals and new social challenges. To resolve these conflicts, well-trained sector experts are needed who have the necessary skills to constructively contribute to possible solutions with great competence. The aim of the M.Sc. AgriFood Economics, Policy and Regulation is to train such experts. With profound systems knowledge, which combines competencies on the technological and ecological level with social science knowledge, graduates recognize and understand the challenges and know which policy measures and incentives can be used to contribute to a solution.          Which further expertise and skills will I acquire?       By linking economics, politics, technology and ecology, graduates are able to recognize the complex interrelationships agricultural systems. Thanks to the skills acquired during their studies, they are able to identify which policy measures are suitable for steering agricultural markets and what effects and side effects these instruments can have. Due to the international nature of the program, students acquire communication skills and intercultural competencies, which are essential for their later work in this field. Graduates are also trained in scientific work and methods, which will enable them to evaluate the latest scientific findings.          Which professional opportunities can I take up with this qualification?       Career opportunities span a wide range from the public to the private sector, both nationally and internationally. Possible fields of work are, for example, in international organisations such as FAO or World Bank, ministries or affiliated authorities at EU, national or international level, in private companies in the agricultural and food industry (e.g. corporate social responsibility tasks), consulting, associations or NGOs. Graduates can also follow a scientific career.             Program structure                   In the first semester, students take four compulsory subjects, which form the basis in the fields of economics, political science, ecology and technology.

I agree           Information on Degree Program              Program profile                    The Bachelor of Arts in Architecture study program at the Technische Universität München provides a sound foundation in the knowledge and techniques that are required for the fields in which modern architects work today. The study program is project-oriented and takes the form of research-oriented lessons. Accordingly, the education program is able to respond to areas of current research. The overall aim is to provide students with a comprehensive university education that communicates fundamental business skills while simultaneously instilling a sense of responsibility towards the built environment for the tasks in the planning process that they undertake. Through instruction in each focus area at the Faculty of Architecture – (Architectural Design / Integrated Building Technologies / Urban and Landscape Transformation / Cultural Heritage, History and Criticism) – students will be educated in holistic approaches to dealing with complex systems from the theoretical concept and its cultural context to the development, arrangement and dimensioning of technical and spatial components as well as the usability and appearance of the large technical objects we know as buildings. The energy efficiency and life cycle of buildings as well as the development and design of building elements and systems are further fields that are becoming increasingly important. Issues of sustainability in the social realm and urban and regional planning are also examined at successive levels from the building itself to more fundamental aspects such as climatology, mobility and energy life cycles. For a comprehensive description of the program, please refer to the degree program documentation: Degree program documentation for the bachelor's program in Architecture (PDF, German)            Which further expertise and skills will I acquire?       Completion of the Bachelor of Arts in Architecture study program at the TU München equips graduates to work in all fields of architectural planning and construction. The program provides a level of education that allows students to qualify for professional practice as an architect in accordance with the rules of the Free State of Bavaria Architect’s Law and the EU architectural directives. After a minimum of two years of practical experience, graduates can apply to become a member of the Chamber of Architects, permitting them to submit planning applications and to bear the professional title of architect. In addition, the four-year study course also qualifies students to undertake a master’s study pro-gram with at least 120 credits, which in turn is a requirement for students to register as a licensed architect around the world in accordance with the International Union of Architects (UIA). After completion of the study program in architecture, graduates of the Bachelor of Arts in Architecture study program at the TU München will have a good understanding of the comprehensive range of aspects covered by the discipline of architecture, and the variety and complexity of the work of an architect, as reflected in the interlinked phases (see the HOAI fee scales for architects and engineers) of a building project.           Which professional opportunities can I take up with this qualification?       The changing social conditions are placing new demands on the architectural profession throughout the world. Graduates of the study programs at the Faculty of Architecture at the Technische Universität München have the necessary skills to assume a leading role in the planning processes of future global markets. The national and international fields of activity lie in regionally active architectural offices as well as in architecture firms operating globally, in product and materials development, in the fields of architectural technology, business consulting, in public as well as private administrations and in positions in the building industry. While the traditional profile of the architect as a designing architect will in future become less and less widespread, the training of architects as designers of social and spatial transformation processes will continue to be useful and relevant in a range of related fields and occupations. Students should, therefore, take the opportunity to pursue an individual specialization as part of their studies at the TUM and through accompanying periods of practical experience. Students can choose to focus on topics that will be growth areas in the coming decades: energy-efficiency and urban infrastructure, renovation and conversion of existing buildings, architectural informatics or transformation processes in megacities. Architecture schools in Germany are training more students than the respective local job markets will in future be able to sustain. This is neither a negative nor unwanted development: at present, more than fifty percent of architecture graduates bring their skills to bear in other suitable and related professional vocations. Architectural studies at the TUM trains architects as generalists. Students learn technical, design and social science competences. The 8-semester regular duration of the bachelor’s study program confers students, after a suitable period of practical experience, the right to apply to be registered as a licensed architect with a Chamber of Architects in the European Union. This freedom allows students to pursue a specialization of their own choosing in their master’s studies, for example in management, humanities or engineering – or in architecture. The TU München offers a variety of suitable study programs. The fact that the bachelor’s degree program confers the possibility to work as a qualified architect enables students to specialize in a direction of their choosing in their later studies, offering a potentially broader range of career opportunities. International orientation and a willingness to be mobile are increasingly important factors for working as an architect. There is growing demand for spatial designers around the world which will shift as growth regions change in future. The integral period of study abroad in the Bachelor of Architecture study program is a first step in this direction. At the university’s center for innovation and business creation, UnternehmerTUM, students are given the opportunity to develop their entrepreneurial skills and business perspective. Founding a company of one’s own based on a service or technology of one’s own making liberates one from the fluctuations of the job market. Architects have always been entrepreneurs.             Program structure                   The Bachelor of Arts in Architecture degree program is an 8-semester long full-time study course. The first four semesters aim to establish a common basis through the training of perceptive and creative design faculties, the methodology of architectural design as well as education in the basic principles of natural sciences and technology and in the disciplines of the social sciences and humanities. These semesters therefore consist predominantly of mandatory courses. The core subject areas of design, urbanism, building construction, history and theory, design and presentation, digital design, among others, constitute 20 weekly hours per semester respectively and 30 credits. The creative process of designing plays a central role: 6 weekly hours per semester are dedicated to project work in the form of a short design project. Related lectures and exercises complement the respective project. In most cases, students spend the 5th and 6th semesters studying at a foreign partner university. The department of international relations at the Faculty of Architecture helps and supports students in selecting their partner university. Using a selection procedure, which considers students’ achievements, personal aptitude and motivation, each student is offered a placement at one of over 90 partner universities around the world. To avoid overburdening students when they are abroad, students are asked to achieve a minimum of 20 credits per semester. Contractual agreements with partner universities set out the number of students admitted and the duration of their stay. In addition, the curricula of the partner universities are closely aligned through Learning Agreements with the curriculum of the Faculty of Architecture at the TU München. The 7th and 8th semesters expand on and deepen the knowledge gained in the previous semesters. In the 7th semester, students can choose from a range of projects with different thematic areas of focus offered by different chairs of the faculty. The remaining subjects are compulsory elective modules to allow students to place greater emphasis on an area of their choosing. In the 8th semester, students undertake their bachelor’s thesis project, which is presented at a final colloquium, and counts for 12+3 credit points.

The aim of the overall program of specialist areas and the mentoring program, therefore, is based on the interests and competencies of the students on the one hand and the individual focus of the chairs for teaching and research on the other. This allows the students a specialization in work-related problems, which are incorporated in the subject areas covered by the four focus areas of the Faculty of Architecture. The fundamental objective is, by means of a comprehensive university education, to enable students to assume responsibility with regard to society and the built environment. Graduates will be ready to take up senior management positions in the planning process and to operate successfully and entrepreneurially. The consecutive Master’s program in architecture will be offered either as a program that is freely defined together with a mentor or as a program with four defined areas of concentration, each of four semesters. In all fields of specialization, design-oriented project work is the central focus. A high level of commitment is expected of the applicants.

The Master's Degree in Architecture (Master of Arts) at the TU München qualifies students both in the general and the specific competencies of the study areas, and in methodological skills as well as social and interpersonal skills. The graduates of all four study areas will be equally able to visualize and pre-sent their created work. They are specifically able to use a wide variety of digital and analogue visualization methods, including modeling techniques acquired within the project work. They will have achieved conviction and confidence in the elucidation and justification of their own design work. They will also have a thoroughgoing knowledge of construction and architectural history and theory of architecture, which for the graduates of the Master’s programs provide the guiding principles for design work. Additionally, students will have at their disposal the social and interpersonal skills that are indispensible in the working environment of the architectural profession. Following their studies, they will be able to collaborate on complex projects cooperatively and productively as a team and they will have been trained to hold their own in conflicts between stakeholders. Through methodological and professional specialization on the Master’s program, together with the project work specifically designed to this end, they will also be capable of handling complex design and construction projects independently and without guidance and to take responsibility whether within a team or working alone. They will be able to work on projects in a sustained and pro-active way, and to be aware of their own strengths and weaknesses in order to achieve set targets in an optimal manner. Through its interdisciplinary and practical, but also research-oriented approach, it will be possible for graduates not only to adhere to a prescribed workflow, but also to develop new solutions and methods and thus excel as pioneers of the architectural methodologies of the future.

Furthermore, graduates will have further developed and refined their professional and methodological, as well as personal and social competencies.           Which professional opportunities can I take up with this qualification?       The occupational profile for biologists is extensive. In accordance with their chosen specialist areas of study, graduates find positions in, for example, pure research at a university, applied and industrial research and development, the food industry, quality assurance or product marketing, as well as in government offices and authorities, and public institutions. For certain positions, a doctorate is recommended.             Program structure                   Around 200 modules in the life sciences and 65 professors enable students to tailor their studies to their own interests. As regards content, the modules offered correlate to one of seven focus areas: biochemistry/cell biology, genetics/biostatistics, medical biology, microbiology, ecology/environmental management, plant sciences, animal sciences. Lectures, seminars, exercise modules, internships and excursions for students in advanced semesters build upon the qualifications obtained in previous studies (in a primarily life sciences-oriented degree program).These courses are largely research-oriented. Emphasis is placed on hands-on experience in small and very small groups, particularly as regards research internships within groups of scientists, where there is 1:1 supervision and the opportunity to make use of tools currently utilized in research. The program offers modules in animal sciences, such as introduction to mammalian cell culture; modules in plant sciences, such as plant physiology, developmental genetics, stress resistance, molecular plant breeding and biodiversity; aquatic and terrestrial ecology; microbiology modules concerning, for example, extremophile microorganisms, food biotechnology, or ecological microbiology; medical biology modules concerning inter alia virology, immunology, oncology or, in the area of biochemistry and cell biology, modules, such as protein design, molecular biotechnology and cell culture technology. The program concludes after 4 semesters (standard duration of study) with a research-oriented thesis completed over a six month period.   In detail:              Overview Degree Program Structure                               (PDF 119 KB)                         Module Catalog: Description of Program Content                                                 Language of instruction                   Required language skills for admission: You need sufficient German or English language skills if you wish to apply for this program.

Chemistry is the most important comprehensive scientific field which effectively combines fascinating aspects from varied areas of research. Chemistry has a long, uninterrupted tradition in Germany, where it is the most economically important science today. Chemistry is the ideal subject for young people interested in sciences who are looking for a broad-based education and who wish to specialize during their course of study without having to commit themselves to a narrow, specialized field at the outset. The chemistry department at TUM offers excellent, up-to-date teaching of the fundamentals of science. TUM is one of the few German universities that covers so many different aspects of chemistry: analytical chemistry, biochemistry, biotechnology, construction chemistry, food chemistry, medicinal chemistry, radiochemistry, technical chemistry with chemical engineering, and hydro chemistry, as well as the classical disciplines of organic, inorganic, physical and theoretical chemistry. Our department’s idea of specialization following a thorough foundation course guaranties a flexible combination of subjects leading to a bachelor or master of science based on the European guidelines. Exams are an integral part of the course, and periods of study abroad are taken into account by means of the European Credit Transfer System (ECTS). For a comprehensive description of the program, please refer to the degree program documentation: Degree program documentation for the bachelor's program in Chemistry (PDF, German)            Which professional opportunities can I take up with this qualification?       After graduation chemists can choose from a wide variety of professions: Industry, research institutes, universities and the civil service offer attractive possibilities. In the sectors of chemical or pharmaceutical industries, chemists usually start in research, where their work is partially determined by practical application, economic climate and market requirements. Industrial chemists improve existing products and processes or develop new ones. After several years of professional experience they often move into areas of production (on-time production taking into account quality, expenditure and material cost), product development, application (optimizing products to customer needs), processing technics (adapting new methods developed in the laboratory for use in general production, considering economic and ecological aspects), analysis, environmental protection, marketing, patenting, documentation or public relations. Further areas of employment for chemists are: the cosmetics industry, the food industry, the automotive industry, the electrical industry, the building materials industry, the metal production and metal working industry, economic consulting, the energy sector, insurance, water supply, timber processing, paper production, law offices (as patent attorneys), national offices and regional authorities (for example, the German national offices for materials testing, chemical-technical testing, hydrography, environmental protection, health and safety), factory inspectorates, customs, fire department, police departments and hospitals. A chemist with a doctorate who enjoys teaching and research might instead opt for a career in tertiary education. Many opportunities are offered at universities and research institutes.               Program structure                   Bachelor curriculum: lectures and lab courses in inorganic chemistry, organic chemistry / biochemistry, technical chemistry and physical / theoretical chemistry, as well as basic courses in scientific mathematics, experimental physics, toxicology, patent law and business administration (all mandatory).

CSE focuses on developing problem-solving methodologies and robust tools for numerical simulation. To understand phenomena and processes from science and engineering, we no longer need to depend only on theory and experiment, but can also use computations. Numerical simulations supplement experiments and can even allow the examination of systems and problems that would be too time-consuming, expensive, or dangerous (if possible at all) to study by experiment alone. The high level of detail and realism in these simulations requires advanced skills in mathematical modeling, numerical analysis, efficient algorithms, computer architecture, software design and implementation, validation, and visualization of results. This program equips engineering, science, or mathematics graduates with the skills required for a successful professional or academic career in CSE.

Graduates will be able to define, to develop and to implement innovative strategies, methods and measures for the protection of biodiversity using the instruments of conservation biology, with a strong focus on landscape planning. They have broad and in-depth knowledge of plant and animal ecology, and can apply this knowledge in conservation strategies and spatial planning. Thus, graduates are able to develop and to implement tasks within the field of nature conservation. This includes the preparation of surveys and expert reports, i.e. the analysis, modelling and management of trends in species and habitats, and the planning of conservation or restoration. Through a series of study projects the students enhance their subject-specific expertise, social competence and other personal skills. In addition, the internship enables them to understand habitats and species relevant to nature conservation in a foreign country. They become familiar with (inter)national conservation regulations, as well as procedures and instruments of landscape planning in Germany and abroad. They can implement essential methods of landscape planning and nature conservation such as assessment, prediction and goal setting for projects in their host country. Graduates are therefore qualified to take up leading positions in state, private and freelance nature conservation and landscape planning, or to work as professional researchers in the corresponding fields. The Master's degree is the standard degree of university studies at TUM and qualifies students for both practical and research purposes and entitles them to do a doctorate.          Which professional opportunities can I take up with this qualification?       After completing the Master's Program, various employment opportunities open up in public, private and freelance landscape, environmental planning and research. Professional options are offered by environmental consultancies and public administration as well as associations and international non-governmental organisations.             Program structure                   The Master's Program Nature Conservation and Landscape Planning takes a project-based approach. The first two semesters focus on individual projects in the fields of landscape planning and nature conservation, which are supplemented by elective modules. This provides a high degree of freedom of choice when developing an individual study profile. The third semester consists of an internship abroad, in which the theoretical knowledge will be applied in practice. The fourth semester is dedicated to the Master's thesis. The prescribed study period of the Master's Program is four semesters in total. By including competences that have already been achieved in a bachelor's program of more than six semesters, the duration of the master's program can be adapted to the pre-studies. The prescribed period of study is thus reduced to two or three semesters (e.g. for an eight-semester Bachelor's degree in the field of landscape planning), the total duration of study for the Bachelor's/Master's degree remains 10 semesters.

Specialist and methodological knowledge is complemented by compulsory work experience in the engineering sector.  The first four semesters cover the fundamentals in the areas of electrical engineering, mathematics, physics, information technology and signals and systems.  A fundamentals and orientation exam gives all those interested in the program the opportunity to orient themselves to the discipline's content. Thus, students demonstrate that they have mastered the essential foundations. The passing of examinations within the first and second semesters is required in order to continue with the program. Successfully passing the fundamentals and orientation exam is an excellent indicator for the successful completion of the program. In this way, students also gain a clear view during the first year of study of the demands of professional life in the field. Those students who do not pass the fundamentals and orientation exam must withdraw from the program.  In the fifth and sixth semesters, elective modules enable students' individual interests and capabilities to come to the fore. In addition, they acquire practical engineering experience and soft skills, as well as complete individual specialized modules and a bachelor's thesis.

They offer habitats for plant and animal species, produce wood – the most important renewable resource in terms of surface area and quantity – and make a fundamental contribution to the common good of society. Forest ecosystems must therefore satisfy numerous demands and, as such, are increasingly in the focus of sociopolitical discourse. In order to balance these diverse and, in part, conflicting interests, careful, long-term and calculated planning is essential. In addition to well-founded knowledge of the forest ecosystem, this demands a comprehensive understanding of systems and far-reaching methodological competence. To this end, the Master’s program \"Forestry and Wood Science\" offers the required specialization. The program's goal is to convey the scientific basis for sustainably managing the forest ecosystem and, in the process, to cover the entire value-added chain, from production in the forest to finished wood products. As such, the focus is equally on the scientific foundations of forestry as well as the technical aspects of exploiting and marketing raw materials produced in the forest. The four supporting pillars of the program – \"Environment\", “Production”, “Society” and “Wood” – are reflected too in six available specialist areas: “Wood as raw/building material”, “Mountain forestry”, “Forest management”, “International forestry”, “Site assessment and use”, as well as “Landscape development and nature conservation”. The course content can be combined and therefore offers, together with an extensive catalog of elective modules, a high level of flexibility in creating one's own individual study profile. For a comprehensive description of the program, please refer to the degree program documentation: Degree program documentation for the Master’s program in Forestry and Wood Science (PDF, German)            Which further expertise and skills will I acquire?       Our graduates have at their disposal an advanced technical training in the economics of forestry and wood and can conduct scientific work independently, as well as plan, realize and lead complex projects. They are able to think through systems, take on responsibility, and incorporate the latest scientific developments into their work. Given the practical nature of the program, graduates are in a position to analyze and assess business and organizational structures, and to independently plan. Graduates understand complex ecological phenomena and can describe how they relate to one another. They can assess the reactions of ecosystems to biotic and abiotic environmental factors and deduce the consequences for ecosystem conservation as well as forest management. They are in a position to evaluate various forms of land use and make judgments about opportunities for, and limits to, sustainable uses. Graduates are able to assess biogeographic, technical and commercial production conditions, and to analyze concepts for the production of forestry resources in accordance with current standards, as well as to develop such concepts independently. They are able to conduct forestry business analysis and planning that takes into account economic, social and ecological factors. At the same time, they are capable of factoring in the demands of the wood industry. Moreover, they are familiar with the market structures of the wood industry and able to distinguish between its production processes. In addition, they can identify diverse interests at play in the use of the forest as resource and analyze actor constellations. They are able to conduct conflict analysis and formulate possible courses of action that are solution-oriented and take into consideration legal and political conditions. They are able to take into account affected interest groups and to communicate their findings in an appropriate manner.          Which professional opportunities can I take up with this qualification?       The degree prepares graduates for diverse areas of employment in the field of forest and wood management, paving the way for activity in science and business. It also offers the opportunity to acquire the necessary technical training for admission to the fourth tier in the state training program for the German forest service. Here, a bachelor's degree in forestry is a requirement. Upon completion, the degree also offers openings in NGOs and development aid, or as a freelance expert.             Program structure                     The degree’s central areas of study are “Production”, “Environment”, “Society” and “Wood”. These reflect the four principle fields of professional employment toward which the program is geared and indicate the breadth of academic training. The first semester deals with the fundamentals of the discipline and its methodologies. These are complemented by an internship and “cross-disciplinary competencies”. In the second and third semesters, students choose three of the six available specialist areas: “Wood as raw/building material”, “Mountain forestry”, “Forest management”, “International forestry”, “Site assessment and use” as well as “Landscape development and nature conservation”. In addition to the choice of specialist areas, the extensive range of available elective modules offers flexibility and the opportunity to create an individual profile without neglecting the breadth of training. The fourth semester is devoted to the master's thesis.  In detail:              Overview Degree Program Structure                               (PDF 103 KB)                         Module Catalog: Description of Program Content                                                 Language of instruction                   Required language skills for admission: You need sufficient German language skills if you wish to apply for this program.

Geodata describe, order, and register human habitats according to particular characteristics, and also contribute to shaping and changing these habitats. In addition to classic measuring instruments such as theodolites, laser scanners, and cameras, geodata is used in information systems, modern satellite technology and digital remote sensors. Geodesists develop automatic, computer-based procedures for the collection, processing, analysis and visualization of spatial information. The diversity of surveys ranges from global satellite-based surveys of the Earth through surveys of regions using airplanes to the terrestrial surveys of construction works and machines performed by engineers onsite. The geoinformation extracted from geodata provides citizens with the basis for legal clarity in the context of administrative and planning authorities and is prerequisite for creative, organizational and planning measures. Geodetic measuring procedures now play an increasingly significant role in catastrophe management, the monitoring of environmental risk, as well as in the exploration of the Earth system and of planets.

Geodata describe, order and register human habitats according to particular characteristics, and also contribute to shaping and changing these habitats. In addition to classic measuring instruments such as theodolites, laser scanners, and cameras, geodata is used in information systems, modern satellite technology and digital remote sensors. Geodesists develop automatic, computer-based procedures for the collection, processing, analysis and visualization of spatial information. The diversity of surveys ranges from global satellite-based surveys of the Earth through surveys of regions using airplanes to the terrestrial surveys of construction works and machines performed by engineers onsite. The geoinformation extracted from geodata provides citizens with the basis for legal clarity in the context of administrative and planning authorities and is prerequisite for creative, organizational and planning measures. Geodetic measuring procedures now play an increasingly significant role in catastrophe management, the monitoring of environmental risk, as well as in the exploration of the Earth system and of planets. The Master’s program in Geodesy and Geoinformation builds upon the fundamentals provided in the Bachelor’s program, deepening students' knowledge of the areas of construction surveying, photogrammetry and remote sensing, higher geodesy and satellite geodesy, cartography and geoinformation science, as well as land regulation and development. During the course of the program, students can specialize in one of the following three areas: higher geodesy and satellite geodesy, photogrammetry, remote sensors and cartography, as well as geodesy, geoinformatics and land management. For a comprehensive description of the program, please refer to the degree program documentation: Degree program documentation for the Master’s program in Geodesy and Geoinformation (PDF, German)           Which further expertise and skills will I acquire?       In addition to a deepened knowledge of the discipline and its methodologies, as a graduate you are distinguished by your focus on quality and your sense of responsibility. You possess a distinctive understanding of spatiality and far-reaching knowledge of the planning, collection, storage, evaluation, efficient computer-based modeling, visualization, use and interpretation of spatial information on all scales, from the local to the global. With reference to specific tasks, you can determine the applicability of various sensors and evaluative processes. You are in a position to assess the input and steps required to deal with complex, discipline-specific problems, and to carry out these steps independently. You participate directly in current purely research projects, as well as research projects conducted in industry, which already provide you with practical experience of successfully completing complex projects. You recognize interdisciplinary connections between the various branches of geodesy and neighboring disciplines and systematically broaden your knowledge beyond the boundaries of your discipline. Students specialize in the course of the program in one of three areas: higher geodesy and satellite geodesy; photogrammetry, remote sensors and cartography; or, geodesy, geoinformatics and land management.          Which professional opportunities can I take up with this qualification?       Opportunities for graduates of Geodesy and Geoinformation arise in research, as well as in different areas of public administration. Further options arise in various branches of the private sector.

Its aim is to map geological structures using geophysical methods from local to global scales and to interpret them using the laws of physics. In mapping, seismic, gravimetric and magnetic measurements are primarily used to record structures from the earth's surface to its core. Numerical simulation is becoming increasingly important in interpretation, as it is used to study complex models of key processes. In terms of methodology, geophysics is characterized by the equal importance of field research and physical-mathematical analysis. The research-oriented joint Master’s degree program in Geophysics at LMU and TUM aims to acquire scientific skills in terms of content, theory and methodology. By teaching advanced geophysical concepts, theories and methods from the fields of geodynamics, seismology and geomagnetics, the course is primarily intended to enable students to gain a systematic understanding of geophysical phenomena. In addition to university research and teaching, graduates can pursue a wide range of careers in the public sector and in the private sector (for example in environmental protection organizations, construction companies or insurance companies). Among other things, they work in the fields of geodata acquisition and analysis, climate research, raw material extraction and processing. In addition, geoscientists work in the fields of laboratory analysis, in environmental consulting and management, or in process or product development, but also as appraisers and experts, in restoration and conservation, or in information and knowledge management.

Laut dem Bundesministerium für Wirtschaft und Energie sollen bis 2025 40 bis 45 Prozent und bis 2050 mindestens 80 Prozent unserer Energie aus regenerativen Quellen kommen. Geothermie kann im regenerativen Energiemix der Zukunft eine wichtige Rolle spielen, um die benötigte Grundlast und Lücken in der Stromversorgung abzudecken. Denn Geothermie ist eine Energiequelle, die im Gegensatz zu der nur fluktuierend zur Verfügung stehenden Wind- und Sonnenenergie kontinuierlich genutzt werden kann. Bayern ist deutschlandweit führend im Bereich Geothermie; hier sind die Bedingungen zur Nutzung dieser Zukunftstechnologie aufgrund umfangreich vorhandener heißer Tiefenwässer besonders günstig. Die Ausbildung von Geothermie-Experten an bayerischen Universitäten in unmittelbarer Nähe zu den bestehenden Anlagen bietet für Studierende einen sehr guten Praxisbezug. Die Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg und die Technische Universität München bieten deshalb in Kooperation den Masterstudiengang GeoThermie/GeoEnergie an. Ziel ist es, hochqualifizierte Fachkräfte im Bereich der Geothermie für den Wachstumsmarkt Erneuerbare Energien auszubilden. Der Studiengang vermittelt relevante Lehrinhalte von der Exploration und Erschließung der Ressource bis zur energetischen Nutzung und Speicherung von Wärmeenergie.          Which further expertise and skills will I acquire?       Der Studiengang vermittelt nicht nur moderne Explorationsmethoden zum Auffinden der Ressourcen, wie seismische Interpretation, Tektonik, Reservoirgeologie und -modellierung, sondern auch die für eine nachhaltige und ressourcenschonende Erschließung und Nutzung erforderlichen Kenntnisse in Geomechanik, Gesteinsphysik, Hydrochemie, Strömungs- und Wärmetransportmodellierung, Förder-, Energie- und Bohrtechnik. Die ökonomisch-ökologischen und rechtlichen Rahmenbedingungen werden durch Lehrveranstaltungen zur Energiewirtschaft, Betriebswirtschaftslehre im Kontext von Energie, Umwelt- und Vergaberecht und Bürgerbeteiligung aufgezeigt. Darüber hinaus werden im Studiengang Qualifikationen erworben, wie: ein innovatives, fachübergreifendes Denken und Handeln bei der Erkundung und Nutzung von Geoenergieressourcen; eine ganzheitliche Betrachtung geothermischer und anderer Geoenergieressourcen– von der Aufsuchung und Erschließung –bis zu ihrer Nutzung und Speicherung; der Transfer der geologisch, ingenieurgeologischen Fachkenntnisse auf andere, das Verständnis des tiefen geologischen Untergrunds betreffende Fragestellungen (z.B. Gas-, Fluid- und Wärmespeicherung).          Which professional opportunities can I take up with this qualification?       Weltweit sind Industriestandorte abhängig von der langfristigen Verfügbarkeit bezahlbarer, grundlastfähiger Energie. Steigende Nachfrage bei sich gleichzeitig verknappenden „konventionellen“ Energieträgern wie Erdöl und Erdgas, die Komplexität „unkonventioneller“ Energieträger, vielmehr aber auch der durch die angestrebte Energiewende hohe Bedarf an „sauberer“ erneuerbarer Energie wie Geothermie schaffen hierbei neue Herausforderungen. Dadurch vergrößert sich zunehmend der Bedarf an interdisziplinär ausgebildeten Geowissenschaftlern, die fachübergreifende Zusammenhänge und Entscheidungsprozesse bei der Erkundung, wirtschaftlichen Erschließung und nachhaltigen Nutzung von Geoenergieressourcen überblicken und anwenden können.  Beschäftigungsfelder: Energie- und Rohstoffwirtschaft Ingenieurbüros für Exploration, Erschließung und Nutzung regenerativer Energien z.B. Geothermie und konventioneller und unkonventioneller Energieträger z.B. Erdöl, Erdgas, etc. Erkundung von Untergrundspeichern Geotechnik und Bergbau Ingenieurbüros und Beratungsgesellschaften Versicherungen und Gutachterbüros Umweltbehörden und –verbände Bildungseinrichtungen Universitäten und Forschungseinrichtungen.              Program structure                   Im ersten Semester findet eine Einführung in die Geoenergieressourcen statt, bei der geowissenschaftlicher Grundlagen vertieft werden.

The aim is to consider and understand this from all relevant perspectives. The degree program is therefore based on five pillars: bio(medical) perspective psychological perspective social perspective context factor: health system research In this way, a comprehensive picture of the structure and functions of the human body and its psyche is conveyed. A further aspect concerns the consideration of internal and external influences and environmental variables. For a comprehensive description of the program, please refer to the degree program documentation: Degree program documentation for the Bachelor’s program in Health Science (PDF, German)           Which further expertise and skills will I acquire?       As a graduate, you will be able to develop strategies in different contexts of prevention and health promotion, develop programs and measure their success. You understand health as a complex construct that is determined not only by medical aspects but also by psychological, social and economic factors. These also include variables such as quality of life and well-being. The preservation and promotion of these variables is of social relevance. Medical and technological changes require a transdisciplinary approach to health issues. Current challenges such as demographic change, high stress levels in the workplace, physical inactivity or lack of exercise, and increasing costs in the health care system require scientifically based approaches to solutions. After graduation, you will be able to take these aspects into account when implementing preventive and health-promoting programs. In order to take the biopsychosocial model into account, you will acquire competencies in the fields of medicine, psychology and social sciences. After completing your studies, you will be able to identify current health topics in combination with the natural and life sciences (e.g. sports and nutrition sciences) as well as with technology-related fields (e.g. computer science, mechanical engineering) and the economic sciences (e.g. UnternehmerTUM) and to work on them in a solution-oriented manner.          Which professional opportunities can I take up with this qualification?       Upon completing the Bachelor’s program in Health Science, professional opportunities arise in various sectors. These include prevention centers, pension providers, care and health insurance providers, the planning and administration of public health care, and research. The Bachelor’s degree qualifies students for further academic education and suitable Master’s degree programs.             Program structure                   In the first three semesters, the fundamentals are taught that enable students to gain a complete understanding of the structure and functioning of the human body, its psyche and internal and external influencing factors or environmental variables. For this reason, all modules are mandatory in this first half of the program. In each semester, all five columns are considered almost equally (horizontally). In addition, the columns build on each other vertically in terms of content over the first three semesters. The research column is additionally to be seen as a connection to the understanding of scientific content from the other columns (matrix structure).  In the fourth semester, a 20-week internship allows for initial professional orientation and setting of priorities. The partially complementary presentation of ICD and ICF perspectives in the first semesters is brought together in the fifth and sixth semesters in the modules Problem-Oriented Learning, Prevention Programs and in the research projects. Individual emphases can be set in the elective areas in order to prepare for entry into the profession or further master's programs.  In the course of internationalization, several modules in English only are obligatory for the study program. This makes it possible for German students to work internationally at a later stage, and makes it easier for foreign students to study abroad at our school.

Of central significance here is the WHO’s definition of health: “a complete state of physical, mental and social well-being, and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity.” The degree program therefore focuses on the areas of health promotion and of prevention. This specialization results from the current stage of development in which the health service finds itself: demographic change along with rising longevity, an increase in diseases of civilization, and mental abnormalities are causing the demands placed on health care specialists to change. The significance of the health of every individual will continue to increase in a society where people tend to live longer, as will the significance of strategic interventions. This requires strategic development to reinforce individual resources, healthy diets, and specific physical activities that are suited to a given age group. In the process, a multidisciplinary approach must give due consideration to issues of gender and diversity, which must in turn be incorporated into communications skills and aired in society. In this way, groups such as those within companies can also be reached, as well as individuals. Therefore, this Master’s program does not only deal in theoretical terms with strategies from the sciences of nutrition, physical exercise, and psychology, but also enables students to deal with people facing various risk factors, or with groups of patients with very different diseases, in the context of interdisciplinary research projects. For a comprehensive description of the program, please refer to the degree program documentation: Degree program documentation for the Master’s program in Health Science – Prevention and Health Promotion (PDF, German)           Which further expertise and skills will I acquire?       Graduates will be able to transmit scientific expertise to specific target groups and thus contribute to a healthy society. Their interdisciplinary knowledge enables them to combine health promotion and prevention strategies for individuals and groups. The holistic approach allows a transfer of specialist knowledge in health, nutrition, and psychology to socially relevant issues. Graduates will be able to choose, develop and foster customized strategies to increase resilience of the chosen target groups with respect to concepts of participation and diversity. They have the knowledge to develop, organize and implement best-practice concepts for health promotion involving social, cultural, and behavior-based factors. Additionally, their advanced knowledge in field and laboratory research permits them to develop, implement and evaluate study designs independently. They are experts in assessing costs, values, and efficiency of international health programs, and evaluating feasibility studies. They are able to judge health concepts and programs with regard to international quality standards. Their expert knowledge and experience permits development of evidence-based principles for enhanced health strategies in consideration of guidelines of good (clinical) practice and ethical aspects. This approach can be adapted to different settings (e.g. kindergarten, companies), populations, and age groups. Moreover, graduates are qualified to implement latest research results in the frame of translational research due to quality standards.          Which professional opportunities can I take up with this qualification?        Leadership and/or advisory function in clinics, hospitals, prevention and rehabilitation centers or care homes  Leadership and/or advisory function in occupational health promotion or in health promotion of children (kindergarten, schools, etc.)  Advisory function for pension, health or care insurances, associations or clubs  Research in scientific institutions (e.g. universities, research institutes)  Research in companies with medical focus Advisory function in ministries (e.g. Committee on Health), authorities (e.g. Federal Center for Health Education, Robert-Koch-Institute) and foundations (e.g. Hanns-Seidel-Foundation e.V.)  Public planning, design and evaluation of health on communal, federal state, national and international levels  Coordination function in other institutions, e.g. adult education centers                Program structure                   The course of studies consists of five central units: 1.    Health Science Research 2.    Research Methods 3.    Applied Research Health and Disease 4.    Complementary Subjects 5.    Master’s Thesis  Every unit offers tuition in specialist and methodological skills from different health sectors for access to prevention and health promotion by the combination of different disciplines in a holistic approach. Every unit combines theoretical knowledge with practical applications for different target groups. The first unit runs over two semesters and fosters a concept of health promotion that exceeds disease prevention by strengthening personal resources, as well as behavioral and environmental factors. Additionally, students can customize their studies in order to focus on zwo specialist area: “Physical Activity”, “Nutrition”, “Psychology” or “Health Economics”. These electives provide the students with methodological knowledge in natural science and sociological prevention research, and lead to practical applications in a scientific context in the following semester.  The second unit focuses on research methods. “Study Design; Ethics” provides a closer look at research and ethical guidelines from different scientific experts. The students may choose to enroll in “Advanced Statistics”, “Qualitative Research Methods” or “Scientific Data Processing”. The third unit offers different electives. Besides transfer of knowledge and methodological testing, the students are given guidance in going through all the steps of their research projects in project teams. Two of the following fields of research may be chosen: Cardiovascular/Metabolic Disorders Mental Health and Well-Being Cancer Neurological Health Economic Evaluations of Health Care Programmes Evaluation Methods in Public Health and Health Care Behavioral Science, Behavior Change and Health Diversity, Inequality and Health The fourth unit offers customized studies in “Complementary Subjects”. These subjects prepare students for different professional settings. This unit allows specialization in one professional context or the option of interdisciplinary courses. The course of studies concludes after the 4th semester with the Master’s thesis (fifth unit). The Master’s thesis carries 30 credits, and should be started after all modules from the 1st, 2nd and 3rd semesters have been successfully passed. Maximum processing time is 6 months.

These include special chemicals, fine chemicals, food and food additives, intermediate products for agricultural and pharmaceutical sectors, as well as additives used in manufacturing, but also, and increasingly, high volume chemical products and fuels. In the process, “white biotechnology” relies on renewable resources and attempts to selectively transform these, with the help of biological systems, into valuable chemical products. As a highly interdisciplinary science, on the one hand industrial biotechnology comprises the biosciences (molecular biology, biochemistry, microbiology, and bioinformatics), which it draws upon in order to identify new biocatalysts. On the other hand, methodologies of (bio)process engineering and technical chemistry are required in order to realize the full potential, in both technical and industrial terms, of new biocatalysts and so as to achieve new and efficient biological production processes on an industrial scale. From this point of view, a special feature of this non-consecutive master’s program in Industrial Biotechnology lies in the cross-disciplinary selection of students: graduates of bachelor’s programs in both the biosciences and engineering can be admitted to the course. At the beginning of the master's program in Industrial Biotechnology, complementary and discipline-specific foundational knowledge is conveyed (process engineering for bioscientists or biosciences for engineers).   For a comprehensive description of the program, please refer to the degree program documentation: Degree program documentation for the Master’s in Industrial Biotechnology (PDF, German)           Which further expertise and skills will I acquire?       The Master’s program in Industrial Biotechnology at the Technical University of Munich aims to provide scientists with a vocational education and training that incorporates broad and pertinent knowledge of methodologies and the discipline. The goal is to train highly qualified specialists able to design and implement new biological processes required in industrial production processes on the interface between the biosciences and process engineering. Graduates will have complemented, and expanded upon, their previous knowledge of the natural sciences and of engineering and, in addition, possess advanced specialist knowledge in the areas of enzyme engineering, metabolic engineering, bioprocess engineering, and bioseparation engineering.           Which professional opportunities can I take up with this qualification?       Opportunities arise for graduates across the full spectrum of bioprocess development and optimization, from the laboratory to the industrial production. In addition to the chemical industry, potential fields of occupation also include the biotechnological sector, plant and apparatus engineering, the pharmaceutical industry, and environmental engineering.             Program structure                    The focus of the first two semesters is on the interdisciplinary broadening out and advancement of students’ existing knowledge. To this end, a mentor assists students with compiling an individual curriculum in accordance with their bachelor’s degree.  Beginning in the second and third semesters, this is complemented by discipline-specific vocational education and training in the specialist areas of enzyme engineering, metabolic engineering, bioprocess engineering, or bioseparation engineering.  Elective modules in the first three semesters provide students with the opportunity to complement their own competency profile with content that coincides with their own interests, whether from additional offerings at the Technical University of Munich or at another scientific institution of higher education.  The program concludes with the master’s thesis in the fourth semester.                Overview degree program structure                                                     Curriculum                                                 Language of instruction                   Required language skills for admission: You need sufficient German language skills if you wish to apply for this program.

Changes in integrated circuits (ICs) technology have had a huge impact on our day to day life. Incredible technological advances over the last 50 years enable us to integrate billions of transistors on a single integrated circuit. At the same time the cost of a single transistor has decreased exponentially. The result is that every day, new attractive applications for the use of ICs open up, enabling the semiconductor industry to grow much faster than the overall economy. However, the semiconductor industry’s capability to make intelligent use of all these transistors in designing successful products has not kept pace with the manufacturing capabilities. The electronics and semiconductor industries are therefore constantly looking for well-educated integrated circuit design engineers. The 2-year full-time Master program includes content that ranges from analog, digital and mixed-circuit design over architectural concepts for integrated circuits to design methodology and automation. Product manufacturing and testing are also addressed. Integrated circuit design is also placed in a broader context, by teaching fundamental concepts of signal processing which are at the core of today’s communications circuits. Students will also be taught essential non-technical topics such as product marketing, international management, patent law and aspects of culture and globalization. This will be mainly done by highly qualified lecturers from the industry.          Which further expertise and skills will I acquire?       Graduates from the joint TUM-NTU Master of Science in Integrated Circuit Design program are technically skilled and knowledgeable on in-depth knowledge in Integrated Circuit Design, with a focus on both the architectural concepts for integrated circuits and the design methodology and automation of circuits.          Which professional opportunities can I take up with this qualification?       Graduates can choose to enter the industry to work in IC Design Engineer roles or in research where they continue as Research Associates/Doctoral Candidate (for PhD). Graduates typically obtain employment in countries like Singapore, Germany and India, with others opting to return to their home countries to work.

As such, the focus lies primarily on open spaces in populated areas. To this end, the program fosters competencies in the social, cultural and natural sciences, as well as in engineering. The focus of landscape architecture lies on the area of design, while landscape planning focuses on aspects of planning science. In order to do justice to the complex demands of the thematic area, the program combines both pillars and, at the same time, allows for early specialization.  For a comprehensive description of the program, please refer to the degree program documentation: Degree program documentation for the Bachelor’s program in Landscape Architecture and Landscape Planning (PDF, German)            Which further expertise and skills will I acquire?       As a graduate, you are in a position to independently handle various types of problems relating to the design of open spaces, the development of landscapes and nature conservation. Based on your specialist knowledge, you also select suitable methods of analysis, assessment, design and planning, and apply these. In accordance with your chosen course of studies, you have at your disposal further technical training and methodological competencies. You can develop design solutions to complex problems and work out their structural feasibility. Alternatively, you will have specialized in the formulation of expert reports containing plans and texts on the status of landscapes and associated development goals. In your work, you draw upon sound knowledge of the areas of construction engineering and plant use, botany and ecology, garden design and the history of ideas, design and CAD, as well as planning theory, instruments and law. Moreover, in accordance with your individual choice of courses, you have at your disposal skills and knowledge relating to architecture and urban design, as well as soil science and spatial planning. Independently of the chosen focus of your studies, your practical planning work shows a consciousness of social, historical and ecological contexts. You will also have developed a basic understanding of questions relating to the natural and cultural sciences.           Which professional opportunities can I take up with this qualification?       Should you decide to enter a profession upon completing the bachelor's program, opportunities arise in architecture and planning firms, as well as in construction and environmental planning.              Program structure                   The Bachelor’s program in Landscape Architecture and Landscape Planning consists of lower-division courses and upper-division courses. The first four semesters are devoted to the lower-division courses. These impart foundational knowledge of the discipline and its methodologies, and provide orientation between the two specialist fields. The compulsory stay abroad in the fifth semester as an internship or course of study expands the specialist skills learned and prepares students for an international career start. In the main course of study from the sixth semester onwards, the focus is on project work in the respective specialization area of landscape architecture or landscape planning, in addition to expanding specialist knowledge through core subjects. Elective modules in the area of specialization also allow students to put together their own individual study and skills profile. The degree concludes with a Bachelor’s thesis, which deals with a topic relating to the chosen specialization.

I agree           Information on Degree Program              Program profile                    Biology remains at the center of the life sciences, which are considered the leading sciences of the 21st century. Biology is the study of living systems and integrates physical and chemical processes into a highly complex dynamic system that incorporates everything from the biochemistry of living cells to organs and organisms through to ecosystems.   The degree program provides broad and fundamental orientation in the life sciences without becoming prematurely limited to specific aspects of their application. Building on the mathematical, biostatistic, physical and chemical fundamentals learned thus far, it provides an introduction to all relevant biological disciplines, as well as the methodological approaches and technological accomplishments in this field. In subsequent semesters an integrative approach is encouraged and, at the same time, students are able to develop their personal strengths in elective courses. You acquire the ability to analyze and abstract complex biological systems and relationships, as well as develop questions and approaches to finding solutions. The degree program is intended to counteract premature specialization, so as to generate the all-rounder graduates of the future: They will be qualified to work on the widest range of research projects and, in the process, always incorporate the perspective of system analysis.   The degree program in Biology, the core science concerning the molecular and systemic understanding of biological processes, trains specialists from both a research-oriented and applied perspective in the life sciences, where the discipline is the central driver of progress. With its wide-ranging approach to the observation of biological systems, the discipline constitutes the generative center of all essentially bioscientific lines of research, out of which new specialist fields and areas of application are continuously developed. For a comprehensive description of the program, please refer to the degree program documentation: Degree program documentation for the bachelor's program in Life Sciences Biology (PDF, German)            Which further expertise and skills will I acquire?       As a graduate of the bachelor's degree program in Life Sciences Biology, you possess more specialized knowledge of the scientific fundamentals of chemistry (inorganic chemistry, organic chemistry, physical chemistry), physics, mathematics and statistics. You are able to link this knowledge to bioscientific content and questions and analyze relationships on a broad range of scales. You can formulate concrete discipline-specific questions, assess a given experimental and methodological approach and apply it in the laboratory or outdoors, evaluate matters scientifically, and interpret the results. You think and operate in an interconnected and analytical manner, work with a view to finding solutions and purposefully apply your knowledge of methodologies. Thanks to the broad spectrum of electives, you possess  individual and interdisciplinary specialist knowledge. You will have learned to take a position on social and ethical questions in the life sciences. Furthermore, the expertise you gain in theoretical modules allows you to solve concrete discipline-specific questions in practice in the laboratory. In this respect, your broad understanding of methodology and your advanced knowledge of cell biology, genetics, biochemistry and bioinformatics provides you with a sound basis. You can draw upon this when it comes to more complex questions concerning e.g. the physiology of plants, humans or animals; or to the systematic approach of ecology.          Which professional opportunities can I take up with this qualification?       Graduates... have practical abilities in the field of biochemistry/bioanalytics, zoology, botanics, microbiology, and genetics. can apply the full range of scientific methods so as to abstract and analyze biological problems with reference to basic structures. are familiar with and understand determinative processes and feedback effects, from the genetic through the molecular and physiological to the organismic level. are familiar with the arsenal of practical methods in the biological sciences and can develop appropriate experimental approaches to the investigation of biological phenomena. Employment in research projects in industry and in public research institutes, qualification resulting from traineeship, administrative role at specialist authorities, science journalism. Generally, however, the aim is to further one’s scientific career in the form of a master’s degree program and, at a later stage, often a doctoral degree at a domestic or foreign university. This then opens up a very broad spectrum and corresponding opportunities in managerial roles.             Program structure                    Attendance times are equally split between theory and the corresponding practice. Semesters 1 and 2 convey the scientific fundamentals (mathematics, physics, chemistry) complemented by organismic biology, cell biology, plant and fungal physiology and a module dealing with social aspects. Beginning in Semester 3, the biosciences dominate with microbiology and bioinformatics. Modules in the Semester 4 convey the systemic character of the life sciences, as well as advancing students’ knowledge of molecules and preparing them for independent scientific work. Beginning in Semesters 5 and 6, a broad range of electives enables students to create their individual profiles.  Areas of specialization: (genetics and biochemistry, microbiology, ecology, plant sciences, animal sciences) must be successfully completed. Semester 5 also serves as an optional mobility “window.” In Semester 6, the degree program is completed with the preparation of the Bachelor´s thesis. In addition, students write a Bachelor's thesis (12 credits), which consists of a graded scientific paper (examination) and an ungraded presentation on its content (academic achievement).

I agree           Information on Degree Program              Program profile                    Building on scientific fundamentals, supplemented by practical experience in the methodology of nutritional research, a comprehensive knowledge of human nutritional needs, the physiological effects of nutrients, and the underlying molecular and biochemical processes in the human body is imparted. The focus of research is currently on so-called personalized nutrition, which strives to take into account the individual needs of the metabolism in nutritional interventions. At the same time, however, our eating habits also shape agricultural production, which has a major influence on the release of climate-damaging emissions. Therefore, the topic of sustainability is an increasingly important aspect of our teaching, for example in the field of food technology or in nutritional physiology when assessing the suitability of vegetable protein sources for human nutrition. Our goal is to educate scientists who work in an interdisciplinary manner at the interface of biochemistry, (intestinal) microbiology, physiology, and medicine in order to investigate the effects of changes in the food environment on the human organism and to show ways to improve nutrition worldwide. Graduates of this degree program have a sound basic knowledge of natural sciences and mathematics as well as interdisciplinary skills in the fields of human medicine, nutritional science, food science, and life sciences. With this knowledge, they can assess the pathophysiological causes of food intolerances and identify the reasons for malnutrition, and use laboratory experience to explore which treatment options are effective. Throughout their studies, our graduates are motivated to develop their own understanding of the multi-layered (biochemical, physiological, medical, ecological, socio-political) implications of the environmental factor of nutrition, and at the same time are enabled to use their knowledge and skills to carry out responsible activities in the professional field of nutritional science. The combination of theory and practice from nutrition research, human medicine, food science, life sciences and public health, which is unique in Germany, offers optimal conditions for a professional future in research, nutritional medicine, industrial food production, or pharmacy. Its operations range from clinical research to product development, food safety, and public health education. With the special focus on “personalized nutrition” or “sustainable nutrition”, there will be a wide range of career opportunities in the future. In the food industry or the pharmaceutical industry, further qualifications with a focus on research are often required, which can only be acquired in the Master’s program. For this reason, many of our graduates are planning to pursue a Master’s, for exampla in Nutrition and Biomedicine at TUM. Degree program documentation for the Bachelor’s program in Life Sciences Nutrition (PDF)              Program structure                    From the beginning of your studies, you will be involved in areas such as human nutrition and physiology, in addition to deepening your knowledge in the fundamentals of biology, chemistry, mathematics and physics. From the third semester onwards, the nutritional science expertise is expanded and deepened, including methodological and technical aspects in practical exercises. This in-depth professional training in nutritional science or nutritional physiology and nutritional medicine is accompanied by modules in microbiology, biochemistry, and food chemistry. On the one hand, the fifth and sixth semesters serve to develop an individual competence profile, according to inclinations and interests through elective modules, and on the other hand, to bring together all the professional and methodological competence learned as well as to prepare for the scientific thesis.

Students of the Master’s degree program in Management and Technology (M.Sc.), predominantly taught in English, learn to recognize, shape, and harness the interdependencies between engineering or natural sciences and business management in companies. The program has a strong interdisciplinary focus. It operates at the interface between management on the one hand and natural sciences and engineering on the other. Students deepen their knowledge of economics, for example, in the areas of innovation and entrepreneurship, marketing and management, economics and econometrics, finance and accounting, or operations and supply chain management. In addition, they choose a technical and scientific focus from the fields of chemistry, electrical engineering and information technology, energy technology, mechanical engineering, computer science, computer engineering, industrial engineering, or sustainable energies. They thus develop a specific interdisciplinary qualification profile. Graduates of the degree program have a basic understanding of scientific and engineering problems and processes and can adequately take these into account in business management decisions. They are managers with a holistic perspective and strong moderation and leadership skills. They are, therefore, ideally qualified to take on positions of responsibility in companies and other organizations and ensure their long-term success.

Regardless of whether you already have an interdisciplinary background gained through a degree combining management and technology or if you are rooted in pure management studies – you will be equally prepared to reach the same goal: Become a skilled business leader with a profound understanding of technical knowledge. The core of the program lies within the two areas of Management and Technology. Both include different specialization options to choose from. At the beginning of your studies you select one out of seven specializations currently offered in the Management area. The same goes for the area of Technology: depending on your previously gained knowledge, you can choose from six different specializations. Depending on the choice of specialization in technology, the degree can be studied up to 100 % in English. Students with an existing technical understanding from their acquired Bachelor’s degree can deepen their knowledge in this area (major) or if you don’t have any previous knowledge in technology, the program allows you to gain basic skills in your selected technology (minor).

Modern education in the engineering sciences must, in turn, prepare students not only in classical disciplines, serving the needs of specific industries, but it must also address the need for interdisciplinary training. The master's program in Materials Science and Engineering rises to this challenge by offering a scientific, interdisciplinary education in engineering, involving a total of seven departments (BGU, Chemistry, Electrical Engineering and Information Technology, Informatics, Mechanical Engineering, Mathematics and Physics). Key objectives of the program include, enabling students to physically and mathematically model complex technical-physical processes and systems accounting for the materials to be employed, that is, to theoretically comprehend and apply the fundamental disciplines of engineering and to chemically and physically describe them. Additionally, the program accounts for the current paradigm shift away from deterministic models towards predictive science. It is this that makes the TUM MS&E program unique, as it is designed to give students a probabilistic view of the material properties of physical and engineering science systems from the start and, thus, to convey the necessity of stochastic modeling, which has not yet made its way into the curricula of other programs.   The MS&E program finds its institutional home in the Munich School of Engineering (MSE). Founded in 2010 with the aim of advancing interdisciplinary education in the engineering sciences, the MSE has established a number of bachelor’s and master’s degree programs to this end. Students of the MS&E master's program, thus, benefit from proven structures and networks that provide optimal conditions of study.          Which further expertise and skills will I acquire?       Upon successful completion of the master’s degree program in Materials Science and Engineering, students have in-depth knowledge of modeling, calculation, prediction, monitoring and testing of innovative material solutions for complex applications across all technology sectors; recognize the need for the quantification of predictive quality, the probability distributions of results, and the quantification of risk and uncertainty; are able to design and implement scientific and interdisciplinary projects in the field of materials science as applied in the engineering disciplines;  and have acquired the methodological and cognitive skills that enable them to develop and carry out research in this field or, alternatively, to seamlessly progress to doctoral studies.            Which professional opportunities can I take up with this qualification?       Graduates are qualified to pursue opportunities in research, development, and teaching at research institutions and universities, as well as in interdisciplinary industries, such as the aerospace and energy sectors, medical technology, testing, measurement and monitoring technology and other sectors in which interdisciplinary engineering plays a central role.             Program structure                   In the first part of the program (semesters 1 and 2), students acquire sound fundamental disciplinary knowledge. In required modules, offered exclusively in English, students are familiarized with materials science, multi-scale models, numerical methods, non-linear fluid and solid mechanics and the quantification of uncertainties. In the second part of the program (semesters 2 and 3), students begin to focus their studies to specialize in one of four areas: Multiscale Material Principles, Materials in Engineering Applications, Uncertainty Quantification & Mathematical Modeling and Material Characterization, Testing & Surveillance. Specialization is completed in two stages: In Area I (specialization specific), students select modules for their elective studies from a limited set of offerings listed in the module catalog. In Area II (individual elective), students select from a broad range of elective modules to suit their specific desired focus. Sample curricula for each of the four areas of specialization are available for your perusal. Modules from both areas I and II are taught chiefly in English, otherwise in German. Fundamental disciplinary training and specialization are supplemented with scientific skills modules (recommended in semesters 2 and 3), as well as with required and elective internship modules in practical scientific work. The Advanced Research Internship (recommended in semester 3) is a special feature of the program. Integrated into an established research team, students prepare a scientific paper under supervision, which ideally results in their first independent contribution to the scientific discourse in their area of research. Required and elective modules are taught in English or German. The program concludes in semester 4 with the master’s thesis module. The thesis should be written in English. A stay abroad is explicitly recommended for students and is offered either as part of the Advanced Research Internship or in the specialization phase in the third semester.

The English-taught Master’s program in Microelectronics and Chip Design (M.Sc.), offered in collaboration with the Technical University of Denmark, Tampere University, KTH Royal Institute of Technology, and Institut Mines-Télécom, equips students with the expertise to develop and implement highly innovative chip designs. The program is based on the latest research and is also strongly practice-oriented. Students dive deeply into the mathematical methods, physical principles, and electronic fundamentals of circuit design and chip development. They acquire all the necessary skills to model and partition complex systems – as they are used, e.g., for artificial intelligence, information security, energy-saving systems, robotics, or medical technology – for circuit development algorithmically or mathematically and to convert the modeling into a form suitable for hardware development. By specializing in either analog/mixed-signal or digital design, students can develop individual profiles according to their interests and professional goals. They apply their skills in a practical project, working cooperatively, innovatively, and effectively in interdisciplinary and international teams to design their own chips. Graduates of the program are highly qualified, innovative, and interdisciplinary engineers. They are capable of taking on tasks across the entire circuit design process to develop and implement specialized, high-quality chip designs that meet specific requirements. This makes them excellently qualified for responsible roles in industry – for example, as system designers, test engineers, or development engineers for digital front-end design, digital back-end design, or analog and mixed-signal design – as well as for continuing their academic work within the framework of a doctorate.

In the age of genetic engineering and synthetic biology, however, it has become much simpler to optimize or reprogram the cell itself. Further, we are no longer limited to “overproducing” only those substances that occur naturally. It is now possible to design and efficiently synthesize artificial biomolecules with enhanced or even new functions. As a result, the technical know-how and added value for a commercial enterprise no longer principally relate to the production process but, increasingly, to the structure and function of the biomolecule. Protein design enables the production of novel active ingredients in medicine, for example, or of “molecular tools” for use in research and laboratory work, or in a whole range of technical areas (from environmental analysis to biochips). The bachelor's degree program in Molecular Biotechnology commences with the production and design of biomolecules. In this context, it combines methods from genetic engineering, protein chemistry and biophysics in an interdisciplinary approach with databases and computer simulations (bioinformatics). For a comprehensive description of the program, please refer to the degree program documentation: Degree program documentation for the bachelor's program in Molecular Biotechnology (PDF, German)           Which further expertise and skills will I acquire?       Due to the large number of required courses, graduates possess well-founded and, to some extent, already specialized knowledge of molecular biotechnology (e.g. in the disciplines of genetic engineering, protein engineering and metabolic engineering), which they can use to solve simple scientific questions. They are familiar with modern analytical instruments and techniques. Thanks to numerous internships in the laboratory and exercises dealing with a variety of topics, graduates possess methodological and manual skills. In addition, they will have acquired further competencies correlating to their individual interests and choice of elective studies. These may relate, for example, to soft skills, project management, bioethical questions or various languages too.          Which professional opportunities can I take up with this qualification?       Upon completion of the bachelor's degree program in Molecular Biotechnology, their first professional qualification (Bachelor of Science) allows graduates to seek employment in industry. In addition to the large-scale pharmaceuticals and chemicals industries, for example, the biotechnology sector in particular can be considered a possible sphere of activity. Given the continuous growth of the biotechnology sector, future graduates can expect to have very good prospects on the labor market.

Further, it has also become possible to design and efficiently synthesize artificial biomolecules with enhanced or even new functions (protein design). This, in turn, has established links to the new research area of synthetic biology. As a result, the technical know-how and added value for a commercial enterprise no longer principally relate to the production process but, increasingly, to the structure and function of the biomolecule, as well as to the (purposefully manipulated) genetic features of the cell (or of the organism) being produced. This field of work therefore requires the interdisciplinary application of the methods of genetic engineering, protein chemistry, biophysics and bioinformatics. The central focus in “molecular” biotechnology is on the biomolecules themselves and, more specifically, on the macromolecules – in addition to lipids and intermediate metabolic products (metabolites) – as well as the cells that synthesize these. Cells, whether microorganisms or cultivated animal or plant cells, are not only of interest as producers but also as objects of study. Technical instruments and resources play a key role in molecular biotechnology. They range from state-of-the-art physical measuring instruments through fermentation systems to computerized methods (molecular modeling and bioinformatics). The interdisciplinary character of this bioscience degree program therefore provides five thematic pillars on which the master’s program is based: biomolecules, cells, organisms, medicine and technology. For a comprehensive description of the program, please refer to the degree program documentation: Degree program documentation for the master's program in Molecular Biotechnology (PDF, German)           Which further expertise and skills will I acquire?       Upon completion of the master’s degree program in Molecular Biotechnology, graduates are able to assess complex scientific questions in the fields of biotechnology and molecular biology, as well as neighboring fields. They can structure their approach and evaluate their research results. They are thus well-positioned to acquire the ability to work independently and scientifically in a doctoral program. They have knowledge of specialist areas, such as protein engineering, molecular microbiology or structure-based bioinformatics and can apply, convey and write about this knowledge. In particular, the degree program enables students to independently identify research questions when developing and applying biotechnological and biochemical lines of inquiry; to carry out studies concerning such questions; to critically scrutinize the results; and to conduct analysis and drive further development. In the field of protein design, for example, they can contribute to the development of biological active ingredients for the treatment of serious illnesses. They are able to grasp the structure and properties of a protein and thus conceive of approaches to changing the function of the protein or first gaining the requisite information on its structure. Further competencies acquired concern methods of molecular biology, such as genetic analysis and cell structure techniques, or enzymatic procedures and their theoretical foundations, which find application in research and in industry. The application-oriented training is particularly advantageous, insofar as it enables graduates of the master’s degree program in Molecular Biotechnology to quickly familiarize themselves with complex tasks.          Which professional opportunities can I take up with this qualification?       After completing their degree, graduates have the option to embark upon a doctoral degree or enter the biotechnology sector directly: Medicine – development of pharmaceuticals and therapeutics, further development of diagnostics and development work on the interfaces between disciplines, e.g. prosthetics, tissue substitutes Industrial biotechnology – development of new processes and materials (including from renewable resources) Agriculture – genetically modified plants and animals, modified microorganisms              Program structure                   The degree program is structured in modules. The required elective disciplines in the core modules provide the foundations and account for 40 credits. The modules cover biomolecules, cells, organisms, medicine and technology. In addition, areas of specialization provide students the opportunity to create an individual competency profile. Theoretical and practical specialization modules are offered, with the latter providing the opportunity to learn experimental techniques in an everyday research setting. The selection from this area must total at least 37 credits. Students can choose from a range of extradisciplinary modules totaling 8 credits to advance their knowledge in languages, politics, economics, ethics, culture and/or interdisciplinary topics. The fourth semester is devoted to the master’s thesis, the topic of which is independently developed during the third semester in the module “Scientific Project Planning.”              Overview Degree Program Structure                               (PDF 119 KB)                         Module Catalog: Description of Program Content                                                 Language of instruction                   Required language skills for admission: You need sufficient German language skills if you wish to apply for this program.

The programme is interdisciplinary and combines experimental and theoretical neuroscience with profound training in engineering. Besides taking a series of mandatory core courses, students will have the opportunity to choose from electives from multiple disciplines and to gain research experience under the guidance of world-renowned faculty. The programme aims to attract high-profile international students and will provide a unique skill set that will open up career possibilities beyond the conventional job market. For a comprehensive description of the program, please refer to the degree program documentation: Degree program documentation for the master's program in Neuroengineering (PDF)           Which further expertise and skills will I acquire?       Graduates will not only enhance their knowledge in neuroengineering, but also develop research skills through the coursework and thesis. Apart from the cutting edge knowledge and technical skills acquired, graduates also develop their basic soft skills.  Beyond the skillsets of only one or two disciplines, MSNE graduates are proficient in neuroscience, engineering, mathematics, psychology, and informatics, which is specifically geared towards solving complex engineering problems with high societal impact.  Students opting to take the additional \"Research Excellence Certificate\" select additional elective courses, perform an additional research project, and present their research project results within their peer group at the NeuroEngineering Summit. Students that graduate with the certificate are able to combine several aspects of neuro-inspired systems and are able to define an own research focus, thereby going beyond the ability to conduct research with the ability to identify an individual research field that allows a smooth transition into doctoral studies.             Program structure                   The programme is designed as a two-year full time (120 ECTS) Master-of-Science training, with an optional Research Excellence Certificate (additional 30 ECTS). The curriculum is innovative in the sense that all mandatory modules include hands-on implementation of acquired knowledge in small-team projects with tight supervision to ensure the students are able to apply the relevant methods and techniques. The Literature Seminar, Scientific Debating, Colloquium builds a framework for individual choice of a topic and related research papers, strengthening their ability to identify relevant research, analyse it, and convert it to their own contribution. Furthermore, the programme includes up to two individual research projects (of 8 and 12 ECTS, respectively) during the semester breaks to enable students to perform independent research early during their education. We offer a mandatory set of core courses to cover all basic aspects of neuroengineering from brain anatomy to neuro-recording, electronics, and computational processing; thereby MSNE students gain a rich toolbox and a deep understanding of neuroengineering concepts, despite the breadth of the field. The courses are conducted in a way that they set the framework for the topic it covers, but enables students during the tutorials and labs to focus on individual problems, thereby preparing the individual qualification towards research excellence. Students are free to select remaining courses (Learning Agreement). The overall timeline is three semesters of classes including hands-on projects, intense projects during the semester breaks (possibly abroad); with a fourth semester for the mandatory Master's thesis. MSNE graduates are trained to act out their future career in an ethically and societally responsible manner, being aware of, and addressing contemporary and future societal needs and challenges.               Program structure                                                       Language of instruction                   Required language skills for admission: You need sufficient English language skills if you wish to apply for this program.

They will have learned – especially after having attended more advanced Political Science classes - to merge this knowledge with insights from Political Science and to build on this knowledge in order to analyze technopolitical challenges, in particular. As students will learn together with students from other programs in the interdisciplinary program component, they will not only attain a basic level of expertise in the subject at hand, but also become acquainted with patterns of communication and problem-solving techniques endemic to other disciplines. In addition, they will encounter situations in which they will practice to function as cross-disciplinary “interpreters” when working with colleagues from other fields, by drawing on their (methodological) knowledge from the field of Political Science and thus making a positive impact on joint project work. Thanks to their interdisciplinary expertise, their methodological knowledge, and social skills they will be well prepared for employment at the intersection of politics and technology. They will become full-fledged Political Scientists, yet, at the same time, will be able to grasp fundamental engineering and natural science matters and communication structures.              Program structure                   As part of their political science studies, students can attend classes offered by TUM’s natural science and engineering schools. Thus, future graduates encounter optimal conditions to meet new political challenges. Besides classical topics in Political Science, the interdependencies between politics, society, the economy, and technology, and the tasks leading-edge technology poses for policy-makers figure prominently in the curriculum. This makes this degree program unique in Germany.

A course of studies in Psychology will be completed that incorporates the full breadth of the discipline, as well as (sub)disciplinary and school-related internships.  Together with a vocational specialization as the first subject, the program is geared towards assuming a dual role as teacher and school psychologist. For further information on the spheres of activity and tasks of school psychologists in Bavaria, see here.          Which further expertise and skills will I acquire?       Upon completion of the supplementary degree program component, graduates are able: to work in the fields of education and psychology as teachers and school psychologists to consistently meet the contending demands of both. to select (in accordance with their knowledge of theory) universal, indicated and selective prevention programs, as well as life management skills programs, and run these with pupils on a one-to-one basis or in groups. to apply diagnostic strategies, case-specific interventional measures and techniques for producing written statements in pedagogic and psychological contexts. to recognize warning signs and risk factors with regard to mental symptoms or disorders in pupils, teaching staff, etc., grasp these within an overall context and initiate the necessary steps. to respond appropriately to crisis situations, both with regard to individual crises (stabilization, dealing with suicidal tendencies, involvement of and referrals to appropriate institutions) and to institutional crises (leadership of the school's internal crisis intervention team, providing an interface for external care providers, etc.). to take a practice-based and action-oriented approach to teaching the central theories, concepts, models, etc. of psychology in associated disciplines and courses (e.g. “Pedagogy and Psychology” in technical colleges, higher vocational schools); structure arguments in the field of psychology with reference to scientific theories and empirical findings; reflect upon scientific content; and work in accordance with current scientific methods. After the bachelor’s degree, these competencies pertain to the choice of subdiscipline within psychology; upon completion of all 140 credits, they pertain to all relevant fields in the discipline.          Which professional opportunities can I take up with this qualification?       For information on the spheres of activity and the tasks of school psychologists in Bavaria, see here. School psychologists are in great demand in vocational schools.  There is an increasing need for counseling and requisite forms of support when it comes to behavioral disorders, as well as problems with learning and performance at school or in the workplace; but also with regard to decisions concerning their academic progress and education. Moreover, given the responsibility of vocational schools for the training of refugees and in the aftermath of such cases as the abuse of a pupil in Augsburg (2018), demand continues to increase. Graduates’ competencies in vocational education and psychology make it feasible for them to enter alternative spheres of activity and, for example, to assume a psychology-related role in industry.             Program structure                   The supplementary degree program component can only be pursued in connection with a TUM bachelor’s and master’s “Vocational Training” program.  For the duration of the program, students are enrolled on both the relevant degree program in Vocational Education and the supplementary degree program component School Psychology. The program in School Psychology encompasses up to 140 credits and incorporates three phases: 36 credits are earned in the bachelor’s phase (Degree: B.Ed. Vocational Education with Aspects of Psychology) 44 credits in the master's phase (Degree: M.Ed. Vocational Education with Further Aspects of Psychology) 60 credits in the supplementary qualification phase (Certification: Certificate of the study of Psychology with a specialization in school psychology; obtained in connection with a master's degree related to the teaching profession) In principle, the modules can be completed in any order you choose and are not tied to a specific phase of study.  By grouping all modules into areas of concentration, you can undertake a focused study of one or several subject areas during the bachelor's phase.             Language of instruction                   Required language skills for admission: You need sufficient German language skills if you wish to apply for this program.

Students of the Rail and Urban Transport (M.Sc.) Master’s degree program at TUM Asia learn to develop and implement transport and rail systems that meet the diverse requirements of sustainable mobility. The program deepens students’ engineering knowledge from an interdisciplinary perspective and develops it further with a view to transport and rail traffic planning. Students acquire specific skills that enable them to develop and implement advanced solutions for the effective and efficient management of various transportation and rail systems. Building on a set of core modules in areas such as statistics, process analysis and management, or modelling and simulation, students can specialize in the areas of “Rail” or “Transport” according to their interests and professional aspirations. A compulsory internship enables students to apply their knowledge in business practice. Graduates of the degree program are experts in developing sustainable transport infrastructures. They are able to recognize the complex and possibly conflicting demands on (urban) transport systems and to develop technically adept and socially responsible approaches to solving them in order to implement socially, ecologically, and economically sustainable structures. Thus, they are just as well qualified to continue their academic work within the framework of a dissertation as they are for taking on responsible positions in transport and infrastructure companies, in consulting, or in public administration.

A vital role is played here by the construction industry when it comes to reducing CO2 emissions, adapting our towns and cities, neighbourhoods and buildings to climate change, reducing the use of resources (e.g. land, material and water), and adjusting the built-up environment to rapidly-changing economic and societal circumstances. Over and above this, roughly 66 hectares of land are approved as housing and traffic development zones in Germany every day , making them unavailable for other uses such as food production, ecological compensation areas, recreation areas or water storage. These are alarming figures given the current size of the global population’s ecological footprint, and in light of the fact that we are overtaxing our planet by more than 1½ times its biocapacity, which can already be felt today. Against the background of ongoing, rapid global population growth and the consequences which this has for equally rapidly rising CO2 emissions and resource consumption, there is an urgent need to place the management of the construction industry on an exclusively sustainable footing. For a comprehensive description of the program, please refer to the degree program documentation: Degree program documentation for the master's in Resource Efficient and Sustainable Building (PDF, German)           Which further expertise and skills will I acquire?       The Master Resource Efficient and Sustainable Building programme graduates are to be able to think holistically and offer their services in resource efficient, sustainable construction as particularly well-qualified engineers, architects and planners. Given their broad-based specialist skills and their interdisciplinary thinking and working, they will help amongst other things to implement the stipulations of national and international law with regard to resource efficient construction. To this end, they will develop constructional design solutions for climate protection, which will continue to be urgently needed, and will help satisfy the increasing need to adjust buildings and neighbourhoods to face the advance of climate change. To this end, the M.Sc. RNB programme graduates will have the necessary skills in drafting and planning at the scale levels of buildings, neighbourhoods, towns and cities as well as regions. They will also have detailed knowledge of the skill areas of construction physics, building services engineering, structural design and life cycle analysis that are relevant to resource efficient, sustainable construction. They will be familiar with the interactions and synergies of these fields, and will be able to apply the knowledge that they have gained in planning and implementing resource efficient buildings and neighbourhoods. As \"interface specialists\", they have both the necessary abilities to optimise the resource requirements, taking account of aspects that are relevant to sustainability such as ecology, economics and sociocultural factors, as well as being able to communicate both with creative architects and planners and with analytically- and technically-orientated engineers, and to communicate their knowledge in a goal-driven and effective manner. The abilities to optimise building and neighbourhood concepts in a resource-driven, quantifiable manner on the basis of engineering methods and to effectively integrate the knowledge that they have gained into the planning process, taking the entire life cycle into account, constitute special qualifications of graduates from this programme. The Master’s programme in Resource Efficient and Sustainable Building (RNB) creates an independent activity profile of a sustainability expert in the construction sector who is able to close the gap between classical civil engineers, environmental engineers, architects and building services engineers. Graduates from the Master’s programme in Resource Efficient and Sustainable Building will be able to analyse connections and insights related to all aspects of sustainable design and building in order to develop solutions that implement resource efficient, sustainable buildings at the interdisciplinary interface between man, buildings, infrastructure and the environment.          Which professional opportunities can I take up with this qualification?       The following career choices are open to graduates: architects’, engineers’ or other planning offices, public authorities (e.g. building and planning offices, approval authorities), experts, consultants, construction companies, industrial production, trade and commerce, research and teaching, and further training and development.              Program structure                   The first semester of the degree programme serves above all to provide fundamental knowledge in the four skill areas : Architecture, city and landscape Building services engineering and renewable energies Building physics and energy efficiency Building technology and life cycle engineering The obligatory and elective modules offered here ensure that all of the programme’s graduates have the core skills forming the basis for resource efficient, sustainable construction. In preparation for the interdisciplinary project, graduates of the Bachelor’s programme in Architecture attend the module entitled “Physical principles of energy-efficient construction”, and graduates with a Bachelor’s degree in engineering attend the module entitled “Aspects of sustainable urbanism”. The above core skills are expanded upon in further obligatory modules in the second semester of the degree programme. The central element of this programme is the “Interdisciplinary Project”, in which the skills obtained so far are implemented and expanded in teams with an interdisciplinary composition (e.g. B.A. AR, B.Sc. BI and B.Sc. UI) in a design-orientated project. The focus here is placed on the interaction between the analysis, for instance of the life cycle-based resource consumption of alternative solutions, and on the synthesis in the context of the design-orientated development of energy concepts in the energy retrofitting of existing buildings and construction of new ones. In this context, the obligatory module entitled “Application of a life cycle analysis” is also part of the second semester of the degree programme, which is directly connected with the application-orientated development work carried out in the “Interdisciplinary project” (IDP). The work carried out in the IDP is highly practical in its orientation. In addition to expanding specialist skills, imparting social skills (e.g. teamwork and team leadership, visual, verbal and non-verbal communication, etc.) in preparation for the IDP is a major element of the first semester of the degree programme and, along with the project, also forms a component of the second semester. Because of the long list of options available, the third semester of the degree programme offers students the opportunity to expand their specialist knowledge in a targeted manner. Moreover, the third semester offers an opportunity to both obtain and contribute specialist knowledge while spending time at other Universities abroad. The fourth semester of the degree programme focuses on the Master’s thesis and the Master’s colloquium.             Language of instruction                   Required language skills for admission: You need sufficient German and English language skills if you wish to apply for this program.

The program conveys the necessary reflexive, collaborative, and communicative skills and tackles questions such as: How can we understand scientific and technological change? How do science, technology and society influence and shape each other? Which inter- or transdisciplinary forms of knowledge production are necessary? How do science and technology differ across regulatory, cultural and policy contexts? It offers a research-oriented graduate education in the flourishing field of Science and Technology Studies for students interested in a comprehensive social science perspective in today’s highly technologized societies.  For a comprehensive description of the program, please refer to the degree program documentation: Degree program documentation for the Master’s program in Science and Technology Studies (PDF, German)            Which further expertise and skills will I acquire?       Students gain in-depth exposure to interdisciplinary approaches to urgent questions about the ever-changing interplay between science, technology and society. STS offers empirical research methods and analytical skills to study the conditions and consequences of contemporary developments in science and technology.  In addition, the program offers optional specializations in the Philosophy of Science and Technology or the History of Science and Technology.  Due to its interdisciplinary orientation, graduates can benefit from theories, methods and a variety of research aspects, e.g. from social sciences, philosophy or the humanities, and are able to apply these to actual techno-scientific problems in a critical and diagnostic way with a focus on problem-solving. The study program mediates the necessary reflexive, collaborative and communicative competencies.          Which professional opportunities can I take up with this qualification?       STS graduates will be able to work in a range of fields including academic research (such as a PhD program) as well as careers in science and technology policy, communication, journalism and management.             Program structure                   The mandatory courses in the first semester are intended to convey a common knowledge base in the field of STS. This allows all students to develop a fundamental understanding and common vocabulary. The modules are structured in such a way as to allow all students to bring background knowledge from their Bachelor’s studies into the discussions, and simultaneously benefit from the previous knowledge of their classmates.  In the second semester, students elect courses from a list of core topics and can begin focusing on a particular field of STS research. Furthermore, methodological training is intensified. The module “STS-MINT” helps students to develop original reflexive perspectives on STEM fields. In this module, students visit courses from STEM fields and reflect on the social, ethical and political aspects of their acquired knowledge. Further explanation and specialization is provided in accompanying tutorials given by research assistants. Students with a background in the humanities or social sciences may visit introductory courses in STEM fields, whereas students who already have a STEM background can elect advanced courses. In the third semester, students elect courses from a list of advanced topics and can continue focusing on a particular field of research. The module “Practicing Research” helps students learn how to develop research projects and prepares them for their Master’s thesis. The fourth semester is devoted to the preparation of a Master’s thesis accompanied by a colloquium.

This structural change requires specialists with a business education based on sustainable concepts as well as knowledge in energy and process technology, biotechnology and material sciences in order to be able to redesign internal company production processes towards resource-saving and sustainable supply chains. This also includes approaches to circular economy. The aim is to develop holistic approaches for the comprehensive use of renewable raw materials and waste, and to be able to evaluate and optimize these in terms of their benefits. In addition, a global perspective is necessary, since companies are in international competition and should be enabled to contribute to the achievement of global sustainability goals. The interdisciplinary master's program in Sustainable Management and Technology bridges the gap between business and technical areas of enterprise. Additionally, it trains the leaders of tomorrow's sustainable economy to understand and shape entrepreneurial developments and their impact on society and the economy in the necessary depth and complexity.          Which further expertise and skills will I acquire?       For the rapidly growing fields of sustainability, managers are needed who know the special features and challenges of sustainability-oriented companies and value chains and can implement these in corporate strategies and management concepts. They should be able to think in economic and material cycles, as well as have basic knowledge of chemical-material and energetic utilization paths of biogenic and regenerative raw materials and be able to develop these further. The Master’s program in Sustainable Management and Technology trains innovative managers who have an understanding of the necessary entrepreneurial structural change and are able to shape the increasingly complex tasks of technological change at this interface between entrepreneurial activities and technical, natural and life science functions. The students acquire competences for the construction, organization, planning, coordination, execution and control of sustainable systems in areas such as raw material procurement, technology development, production and logistics, marketing and sales or controlling and accounting, taking into account business, macroeconomic, ecological and social effects. They can use their acquired technical and scientific fundamentals of the individual stages in the value chains – from cultivation to recycling – including key technologies of sustainable chemistry and energy management, biotechnology, material sciences and digitalization to analyze the basis for management decisions and their effects from a technical and scientific perspective. They will also gain insight into other disciplines in order to be able to acquire knowledge independently in the future so that they can use this independently in the subject- and discipline-specific as well as interdisciplinary forms of problem-solving and decision-making. As business is not only regionally or nationally limited, but embedded in a globally networked and digital society, students are empowered to be able to work in international teams on solutions to sustainability issues.          Which professional opportunities can I take up with this qualification?       With the skills acquired in the Master’s program, graduates are able to analyze, develop, implement and disseminate the sustainable idea in companies in all economic sectors of industry, trade, finance and consulting and in all operational functions (such as research and development, purchasing, production, sales and controlling) in a methodologically sound and innovative manner as analysts, innovators and mediators across functions and disciplines.             Program structure                   The master's program is offered with two options for specialization: Major in Biotechnology and Material Sciences (BMS) Major in Sustainable Management (SM) Each major is divided into four areas: Fundamentals in Sustainable Management, Electives in Management and Technology, Specialization in Engineering and Natural Sciences, and the Master's Thesis. In Fundamentals in Sustainable Management (30 ECTS) students gain depth knowledge in the areas of economics, sustainability and research methodology. Electives in Management and Technology include modules from the fields of social sciences, economics, engineering and natural sciences (BMS: 30 ECTS, SM: 45 ECTS). In the elective area Specialization in Engineering and Natural Sciences, the technical and scientific fundamentals along the value chains up to the utilization of residual materials are taught (BMS: 30 ECTS, SM: 15 ECTS).

Students of the English-taught Master’s degree program Sustainable Resource Management (M.Sc.) therefore learn to develop and implement strategies for ecologically, economically, and socially sustainable resource management. The degree program is highly interdisciplinary. It combines natural sciences with sustainability theories, management strategies, and social science perspectives. Students learn to analyze and evaluate production chains, material flow systems, technical processes, and human actions in terms of their sustainability. They acquire the necessary skills to identify interest groups, understand conflicting goals, and develop and implement appropriate solutions. Depending on their interests and talents, they can specialize in the areas of Climate, Air and Water, Economic and Political Dimensionsof Sustainability, Landscape Management, Management and Protection of Forest Ecosystems, Material and Waste Management, Renewable Resources, Soils and Soil Management, Sustainable Agricultural Systems and Products, or Wildlife and Protected Area Management. A compulsory eight-week work placement promotes the transfer into practice. Graduates of the degree program are innovative and analytically sharp-minded generalists in sustainable resource management. They are able to develop and implement comprehensive, scalable, and resilient solutions for the sustainable management of natural resources. This makes them just as well qualified to continue their academic work as part of a doctoral thesis as they are for responsible positions in large companies, environmental consulting, national and international non-governmental organizations, or public administration. For a comprehensive description of the program, please refer to the degree program documentation: Degree program documentation for the Master’s program in Sustainable Resource Management (PDF)               Program structure                   The four-semester Master’s program consists of compulsory modules (20 credits), elective modules (70 credits), and a Master’s thesis (30 credits). The first semester consists of four compulsory basic modules to bring all students to the same well-founded level of knowledge, to impart basic skills, and to facilitate entry into the degree program for international students. In addition, you choose your first elective modules. During your studies, you will choose elective modules out of nine science topics. In each science topic we have at least four elective modules (5–6 credits each) and you have to earn at least 45 credits in total from the science topics. You can choose from the following topics: Climate, Air and Water Economic and Political Dimensions of Sustainability Landscape Management Management and Protection of Forest Ecosystems Material and Waste Management Renewable Resources Soils and Soil Management Sustainable Agricultural Systems and Products Wildlife and Protected Area Management By choosing modules from the nine Science Topics, you create your own individual profile. In addition, you can take further free elective modules, which you can choose from a wide range of subjects according to your own interests and preferences (up to 25 credits). The free elective modules also include a general education subject (e.g. language courses) or a professional internship of at least seven weeks in the field of resource management. During the internship, you can gain valuable initial experience, get an insight into the wide range of employment opportunities in your subject area and make contact with potential employers. You can complete the internship in Germany or abroad. In order to receive your 10 credits for the internship, you are required to write an internship report. In the fourth semester, you will complete your studies by writing a Master’s thesis.
