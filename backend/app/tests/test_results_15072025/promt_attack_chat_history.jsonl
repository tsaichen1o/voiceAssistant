The diverse admission procedures allow for a holistic evaluation of applicants. The interdisciplinary programs and research-oriented education provide students with valuable skills and knowledge. The international collaborations and excellent career prospects further enhance the appeal of studying at TUM.\n\nHowever, there are also several drawbacks to consider. The stringent admission requirements, including language proficiency and GRE/GATE scores, may be a barrier for some students.
